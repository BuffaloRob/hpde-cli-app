# Hpde

Welcome to the High Performance Driving Event scraper. I love the site hpdejunkie.com but in order to find an event close enough to actually attend I needed to click on every single day on their calendar. This scraper takes care of that problem by listing the days that have events and the tracks they're located on. From there you can choose a specific day to see who is running the event.

## Installation

Clone this repo

While inside the repo's directory type bundle into the CLI and hit enter (if bundle isn't installed you will have to do that first)

Then type this into the CLI and hit enter. This will start the program:
```ruby
    ./bin/hpde
```
<!-- Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hpde'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hpde -->

## Usage

1) Type ./bin/hpde and hit enter to start the program
2) Type the number of the corresponding region you would like to view.
3) Type the numerical representation of the month you want to check out.
4) Type the day number that you would like to view in more detail.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
